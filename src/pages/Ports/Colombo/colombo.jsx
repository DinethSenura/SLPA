              Since 1918, the Port of Colombo had been administered by the Colombo Port Commission, a Government
              Department which was made responsible for the supply and maintenance of cargo-handling equipment and other
              infrastructure, pilotage services, docking and slipping. The government had funded all its activities.
              Stevedoring and shore handling activities were in the hands of several private Wharfage Companies. In
              1958, the Port Cargo Corporation was set up to take over these activities performed by a multiplicity of
              operators. The Port Tally and Protective Services Corporation was formed in 1967 in order to perform
              on-board tallying and watchmen services on behalf of Agents.
